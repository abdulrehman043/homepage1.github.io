              <h3>What is Stock market ?</h3>
              <div class="right">
                <img src="./img/stock.jpg" width="300px" height="270px">
              </div>
            <p>You must have heard about the stock market at least once in your life. But what actually is
                the stock market? Is it any different from the market in the economy where you do
                transactions in your day to day life everyday? The answer is no. It’s all that different. It has
                only a slight difference that is in the stock market you trade in the shares of a company. You
                can own as many shares as you want of as many companies as you can as long as you’re
                capable of having the right of money to be able to purchase your desired amount of stocks.</p>
    

            <p>So basically,
                The stock market is where you can buy, sell, and trade stocks any business day. It's also
                called a stock exchange, and works like an auction where investors buy and sell shares of
                stocks. Stocks allow you to own a share of a public corporation. Stock prices usually reflect
                investors' opinions of what the company's earnings will be.
                There’s a specified time for the stock market to operate and specified days in a week. In
                india, the timings are from 9:15am to 3:30pm and the operating days are from Monday to
                Friday.</p>
            
                <h3>How it works ?</h3>
                <div class="left">
                  <img src="./img/stock2.jpg" width="300px" height="290px">
                </div>
                <p>One can buy stocks that are of value of .0.5 paisa to stocks worth in thousands per share.
                    One needs a demat account to be able to trade in the stock market. You can trade yourself
                    or ask the broker to trade on behalf of you. But the final decision is always yours. He will buy
                    and sell the shares at whatever price you ask him to. Every transaction in the trading
                    charges 20rupess as a brokerage. Even if you bought 1 share of some company named
                    xyz.ltd worth 5rs, you’ll be charged 20rs that will be debited from your trading account as a
                    brokerage fee.</p>
                    <p>The stock market is uncertain, just like the free market where the prices of goods change
                        due to the changes in the factors related to it. Assume there’s a bad harvest of wheat this
                        year? What does it mean? There will be less wheat that is less supply and more of demand
                        compared to the supply. As the demand won’t exactly decrease. It will lead to inflation which
                        will result in an increase in the prices of wheat. Let’s understand this concept with a stock
                        now. Imagine you have 10000rs and you’re buying a share of a company named abc.tld
                        which deals in the construction of houses and it’s share costs 100rs per share. Now due to
                        some economic changes they get more projects or get to collaborate with more companies
                        that will result in their profits? How will it result when it comes to shares? The prices of share
                        will increase from 100rs which can go to anything depending on the demand and supply of
                        the shares in the market.</p>
            
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>To be able to earn profit one needs to know exactly when to buy the shares and when to sell
                            them. By keeping a tab on it’s graph, checking the company’s performance, it’s news,
                            everything like these can help one understand a little bit better as to how to earn profit in the
                            stock exchange.
                            It’s funny when you realise that this game of earning profit in the stock market is
                            weird in the sense that it is nothing but a big pool where everyone is just investing some
                            amount and incurring profits and loss from it. Like imagine there’s 5 friends, each having
                            20rs and investing it in something worth 100rs. Now as they trade, one might in the end gets 30rs, or 25rs,10rs, 20rs, and 15rs. Some of them will have profit and some might incur loss.
                            </p>
            <p>In the end, it’s just a very big pool where you need to learn how to make money out of this.
                One will have loss at some point or another but it won’t actually be a loss unless you don’t
                learn from your mistakes and learn something new, how to trade so that it becomes a child’s
                play for you.</p>
